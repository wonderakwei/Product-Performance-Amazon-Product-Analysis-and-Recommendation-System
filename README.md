- **Price Metrics**: Understand the dynamics of product pricing with both the discounted and actual prices provided, along with the discount percentage.

- **Rating Insights**: Access the product's overall rating and the number of individuals who contributed to that rating.

- **User Feedback**: Delve into the specifics of user reviews, including the user's ID, name, review title, detailed review content, and corresponding review ID.

- **Product Media**: Direct links to product images and the official product page on Amazon.

## Inspiration

Amazon, a pioneering American tech multinational, has revolutionized the e-commerce landscape. With its end-to-end business model covering inventory management to customer service, Amazon stands as a beacon in the retail industry. This project aims to derive meaningful insights, create innovative solutions, and explore the vast potential of e-commerce data.

The goal is to unravel customer preferences, decipher purchasing trends, and develop a recommendation system capable of suggesting products aligned with user interests.

## Project Outline

1. **Data Collection**: We'll procure the Amazon products dataset from Kaggle.

2. **Data Preparation**: Dive into the dataset, cleansing and preprocessing it to ensure pristine analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover the dataset's secrets, exploring the distribution of products across categories, customer ratings, and reviews.

4. **Data Visualization**: Illuminate the data's nuances through captivating visualizations, identifying trends and patterns.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilize the VADER Sentiment Scoring method to analyze sentiments in reviews, providing additional insights.

6. **Simple Recommendation System**: Employ machine learning algorithms to fashion a recommendation system, steering users toward products aligned with their interests and past choices.

## Sentiment Analysis

For Sentiment Analysis, the VADER Sentiment Scoring method is employed. This involves utilizing the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer from the NLTK library to derive scores indicating negative, neutral, or positive sentiments from the reviews. The analysis reveals a clear correlation between product ratings and sentiment expressed in reviews.

## Recommendation System

As a data scientist, the objective is to assist users in discovering products tailored to their preferences. The recommendation system is being developed utilizing an Amazon dataset, encompassing details about products, reviews, and users. The system provides personalized recommendations based on users' interests and prior interactions, enhancing the shopping experience with tailored suggestions.

The recommendation system stands as a pivotal tool, fortifying the bond between businesses and their clientele, driving user satisfaction, and boosting revenue growth.
