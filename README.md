Amazon, a groundbreaking American tech giant, has reshaped the e-commerce paradigm. Covering everything from inventory to customer experience, Amazon stands out in the retail sector. This project successfully extracted insights, proposed innovative solutions, and tapped into the immense potential of e-commerce data.

The project's purpose was to decode consumer inclinations, interpret buying patterns, and craft a recommendation mechanism to align products with user preferences.

## Project Outline

1. **Data Collection**: The Amazon products dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

2. **Data Preparation**: Extensive work was done to explore, clean, and preprocess the dataset, ensuring its readiness for thorough analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Deep dives into the dataset unveiled product distribution, customer ratings, and reviews across categories.

4. **Data Visualization**: Various visual tools were employed to present data trends and patterns effectively.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: The VADER Sentiment Scoring method from the NLTK library was utilized to gauge sentiments from reviews, highlighting correlations with product ratings.

6. **Recommendation System**: Leveraged machine learning to design a recommendation system, providing users with product suggestions tailored to their tastes and past interactions.

## Sentiment Analysis

Using the VADER Sentiment Scoring method, sentiment insights were extracted from the reviews. The analysis distinctly showcased the relationship between product ratings and the sentiments conveyed in the reviews.

## Recommendation System

The project aimed to elevate user experience by tailoring product suggestions. By harnessing the Amazon dataset, which encompassed product, review, and user details, a recommendation system was developed. This system's personalized recommendations enriched user interactions, strengthening business-consumer relationships and fostering revenue growth.
